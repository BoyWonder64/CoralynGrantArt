        Hi Im Maitland! I am almost finished up at Weber State University with
        my Bachlors from Weber State University. I already got my Assocaites
        from SLCC and cannot wait to finally be finished with school. <br />

        Since I could remember, I have been using a computer since I could talk.
        During my early childhood I spent time playing Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam.
        I still love these games and often look back at them for inspiration.
      </p>

        I enjoy creative problem-solving, and yes I do enjoy debugging. In my
        free time, I listen to mountain bike, read books, and 3D Printing. The
        biggest thing I have ever made was a full suit of armor.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />I now work for a company called Motorola Solutions as a software
        engineer. I currently work on the Statelink team. I mostly code in Java
        and sometimes C++ depending on the bug or project.
